## üí° Design Choices

### Architecture
- **Component-Based Design**: Organized code into reusable, modular components for maintainability
- **Context API**: Used React Context for state management (shopping cart, authentication)
- **Responsive First**: Designed for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even if JavaScript is disabled

### UI/UX Design
- **Clean, Accessible Interface**: Focused on ease of use and accessibility
- **Modal Dialogs**: Used for product details to prevent unnecessary page navigation
- **Visual Feedback**: Animations for actions like adding to cart or form submissions
- **Consistent Styling**: Used Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a cohesive look

### Data Management
- **Local Storage**: Used for persisting cart and user data between sessions
- **Mock Data**: Implemented detailed mock product data with all required attributes
- **Query Caching**: Used Tanstack Query for efficient data fetching and caching

## üß© Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Product Detail Display
**Problem**: Needed to show detailed product information without navigating away from the current page.
**Solution**: Implemented a modal approach that overlays product details on the current page, maintaining context while providing all required information.

### Challenge 2: Cart State Management Across Pages
**Problem**: Cart updates from the home page weren't reflecting in the header and other pages.
**Solution**: Refactored the CartContext to use a more robust state management approach and ensured the addToCart function was consistently implemented across all product cards.

### Challenge 3: Form Validation and User Experience
**Problem**: Needed robust form validation for login/signup while maintaining a good user experience.
**Solution**: Implemented centered modal forms with animations and clear validation feedback, preserving context while ensuring data integrity.

### Challenge 4: Responsive Design for Various Device Sizes
**Problem**: Ensuring the application looks and works well on all device sizes.
**Solution**: Used Tailwind's responsive classes systematically and tested across multiple viewport sizes to ensure consistency.
